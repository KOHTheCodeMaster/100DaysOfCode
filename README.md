Day 03: Image Gallery

Learnings: CSS box model, margin, padding, img, float

Thoughts:
Understood the concept of box model and how each element is treated as a box in CSS. Took an attempt to design simple Tic-Tac-Toe game board using CSS borders.
Designed basic Image Gallery page which made me realize the power of CSS. Looking at the results before & after applying CSS is astonishing.

Day 02: Intro. to CSS
21st October 2K20, 10:50 PM

Learnings: basics of CSS, colors, borders, CSS selectors, advanced CSS selectors, texts & fonts, google fonts

Thoughts:
Covered up the basics of CSS. Its actually fun & am already enjoying it. Got the grasp of general rules of CSS. Although didn't made any beautifully styled pages yet but understood the convention of using external CSS stylesheets for all the styling & HTML for only the structure of the web page.

Day 01: Intro. to HTML
20th October 2K20, 10:47 PM

#100daysofcode #html

Learnings: HTML boilerplate code, tables, forms, inputs and other tag elements

Thoughts: 
Completed the basics as well as intermediate of HTML. As I already knew some of the basics, so it didn't took me long to complete it. Reviewed the basics of HTML and got grasp over tables, forms & several input elements. 

"Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind." ~Dale Carnegie

Since I believe in this philosophy, no matter how little or small it be, I try to use the knowledge to make something out of it. So, using plain HTML tables I made simple chart of first gen Pokemon. Although it is nothing beautiful but that is for later part when CSS comes into the picture for styling.

It was the first day and I could already feel its going to be an amazing journey. Good start, looking forward to grab the pace & keep learning.
