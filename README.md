Day 01: 100 Days Of Code

#100daysofcode

I've decided to accept this challenge of 100daysofcode with the goal of learning full stack web development.
Hopefully this journey helps me to improve my programming skills as well as my GitHub profile and portfolio by working upon several projects.
I'm willing to fulfil this commitment and am accountable for documenting my daily progress with the tag '#100daysofcode'

Rules
------

1. The main rule: Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

2. Post my progress daily at LinkedIn with the hashtag: #100DaysOfCode

3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
   If you want, you can follow me here - https://github.com/kohthecodemaster/100daysofcode

4. I will mostly be working with Web Development through following sources:
   a. FreeCodeCamp.org
   b. YouTube tutorials & playlists
   c. Online courses - LinkedIn learning, Udemy, Coursera, etc.
   d. Blogs, articles, other people's codes - Medium, Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.
   e. Others - Books & other references
