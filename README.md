Took a day off from bootstrap and explored FreeCodeCamp.org website. It is a wonderful learning resource for web development. One thing about it that intrigued me is its interactive sessions for every learning, there is always a hands-on practice exercise which enhance the level of understanding and promotes "learning by doing" step-by-step.

Day 01: Intro. to HTML

#100daysofcode #html

Learnings: HTML boilerplate code, tables, forms, inputs and other tag elements

Completed the basics as well as intermediate of HTML. As I already knew some of the basics, so it didn't took me long to complete it. Reviewed the basics of HTML and got grasp over tables, forms & several input elements. 

"Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind." ~Dale Carnegie

Since I believe in this philosophy, no matter how little or small it be, I try to use the knowledge to make something out of it. So, using plain HTML tables I made simple chart of first gen Pokemon. Although it is nothing beautiful but that is for later part when CSS comes into the picture for styling.

It was the first day and I could already feel its going to be an amazing journey. Good start, looking forward to grab the pace & keep learning.
