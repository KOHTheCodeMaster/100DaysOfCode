Thoughts:
Finished the logical part of the game as well. Added JS & jQuery for DOM manipulation. Handled all the event listeners for all the buttons and color tiles of the game grid. The game is now in stable condition & working smoothly. Although it ain't something that big of an achievement, but I still counts it as a little milestone.

Cheers to many more milestones coming in the near future.

Day 20: Intro to jQuery
8th November 2K20, 10:42 PM

Learnings:
1. Select elements using $("cssQuerySelector")
2. Add, remove & toggle classes using jQuery methods
3. Other methods similar to vanilla js including text, html, attr

Thoughts:
Introduction to jQuery. Understood the role of jQuery. Anything that can be done with jQuery can be done without jQuery as well but its about ease of code and clarity. Where it takes long lines of code for particular task, jQuery has inbuilt method/way to do that with just a few lines of code & is more robust.

There's actually a website "http://youmightnotneedjquery.com" which illustrates examples of replicating things done with jQuery using plain js & supports why not to choose jQuery. But its considered worth knowing how to write code with / without jQuery.

Day 19: Advanced DOM Manipulation
7th November 2K20, 10:24 PM

Learnings:
1. Add, remove & toggle classList
2. textContent & innerHTML
3. getAttribute & setAttribute
4. Adding event listeners on elements

Thoughts:
Dived deeper into DOM for advanced manipulation. Generally its considered good practice to add or remove css classes to the elements rather than explicitly specifying the styles with javascript code. Understood the difference between textContent & innerHTML as well as the use of get & setAttribute methods.

Event listeners makes the webpage interactive and simply adds new flavor. Used all the knowledge gained so far about DOM to build a basic 'Scorekeeper' application.

Day 18: Document Object Model
6th November 2K20, 10:24 PM

Learnings: 
1. document - the root element of the DOM
2. 5 ways to select elements (id, class, tag, querySelector, querySelectorAll)
3. Node list of elements similar to arrays
4. Manipulate DOM for blinking effect
5. setInterval method for timely iterations

Thoughts:
DOM - Document Object Model. Worked with 5 ways of selecting the elements using document methods including id, class, tag, querySelector & querySelectorAll. Difference and similarities between node list and arrays. The querySelectorAll method of document returns node list of elements rather than an array. Using setInterval method to change the text colod and background color of elements in timely manner which appears to be a blinking effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 17: JS Objects
5th November 2K20, 09:44 PM

Learnings:
1. JS object, function as part of object i.e. method 
2. Two ways of accessing keys of object i.e. obj.name & obj["name"] 
3. Using variable to access key of an object
4. this keyword

Thoughts:
JS objects and functions as part of objects i.e. methods. Understood the difference between arrays and objects as well as using the objects with arrays and vice versa according to the scenario. It is similar to the dictionary or map in other programming languages but it allows 2 ways to access its keys i.e. via dot as well as [ ] operators. Also worked with the 'this' keyword to use the properties/fields of the object inside the methods of the object itself.

Day 16: JS Arrays
4th November 2K20, 10:51 PM

Learnings: javascript array functions including push, pop, shift, unshift, indexOf, slice. Array iteration using forEach method.

Thoughts:
Worked with fundamental and one of the most basic data structure i.e. Arrays. Its mostly similar to other programming languages like indexOf method. Slice method is used for splitting and segmentation and also forEach is a method of the array in javascript unlike the language construct in Java.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 15: Loops, Functions & Scope
3rd November 2K20, 11:04 PM

Learnings: for and while loops, functions and arguments, local and global scopes

Thoughts:
Practiced basic loops and functions using arguments. Understood the difference between local and global scopes of the variables. One thing that I found quite different from other programming languages is that in case of insufficient or missing arguments in functions, it doesn't crashes and doesn't throws any exceptions but rather implicitly handles it by initializing such variables as undefined.

Day 14: JS Codeflow
2nd November 2K20, 10:01 PM

Learnings: Boolean logic and exceptional cases, == vs === operators, conditional blocks if-else-if

Day 13: Intro. to JS
1st November 2K20, 09:18 PM

Learnings: 5 primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined), prompt, alert, log

Thoughts:

Understood the basics of JS including its syntax and how to include an external JS file. Within a couple of days I'll get more familiar and comfortable with it and start making some mini-projects.

26th October 2K20, 11:11 PM

Learnings: Basic html and html5

Thoughts:
Took a day off from bootstrap and explored FreeCodeCamp.org website. It is a wonderful learning resource for web development. One thing about it that intrigued me is its interactive sessions for every learning, there is always a hands-on practice exercise which enhance the level of understanding and promotes "learning by doing" step-by-step.
Completed 'Basic HTML and HTML5' section of responsive-web-design at freecodecamp.org

2. Grid System - different sizes / break points - col-lg-*, col-md-*, col-sm-*, col-*, offset-*

Thoughts:
Deep dive into bootstrap navbar & its different classes. Took me a lil. while to understand the use-case of various classes by playing with some of them including navbar-nav, navbar-collapse, navbar-toggler, etc. Also worked with basics of grid system & how to make page responsive with different screen sizes using different classes. Next looking forward to implement all this knowledge of bootstrap and explore more.

21st October 2K20, 10:50 PM

Learnings: basics of CSS, colors, borders, CSS selectors, advanced CSS selectors, texts & fonts, google fonts

Thoughts:
Covered up the basics of CSS. Its actually fun & am already enjoying it. Got the grasp of general rules of CSS. Although didn't made any beautifully styled pages yet but understood the convention of using external CSS stylesheets for all the styling & HTML for only the structure of the web page.

Day 01: Intro. to HTML
20th October 2K20, 10:47 PM

#100daysofcode #html

Learnings: HTML boilerplate code, tables, forms, inputs and other tag elements

Thoughts: 
Completed the basics as well as intermediate of HTML. As I already knew some of the basics, so it didn't took me long to complete it. Reviewed the basics of HTML and got grasp over tables, forms & several input elements. 

"Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind." ~Dale Carnegie

Since I believe in this philosophy, no matter how little or small it be, I try to use the knowledge to make something out of it. So, using plain HTML tables I made simple chart of first gen Pokemon. Although it is nothing beautiful but that is for later part when CSS comes into the picture for styling.

It was the first day and I could already feel its going to be an amazing journey. Good start, looking forward to grab the pace & keep learning.
